- Bugs
	- Anything except solid brushes intersecting with an object causes FPS to GRADUALLY decrease. Removing the not solid brush from the object will make FPS GRADUALLY increase (in gm_construct).
	- Bouyancy calculations taking too long(?) Large amounts of lag caused if many objects are intersecting with water at once.
	- Dynamite model acts odd (inconsistency between server and client predictions?) Physical model is detached from graphical model.
	- IsAsleep() returning true causes lag freeze (Only when object asleep on displacements?)
	- The player's shadow flies off when noclipping.
	- Mystical magnetic properities depending on if using singlethreaded or multithreaded.
		- Singlethreaded: attractive (literally, use your physgun)
		- Multithreaded: repulsive (object will bounce if on top of another)
	- Crash in materialsystem on map change. (Possibly same crash as removing jeeps?)
		- First exception occurs at CPhysicsEnvironment.cpp:587 (at the time of writing)
	- Immense lag when an object is welded to world and crash when removing that weld in materialsystem
	- VEHICLES:
		- One of the wheels fly off in vehicle creation. (front left)
		- Removing a vehicle will cause the game to crash about a second later (delay caused by remover tool deleting parented objects?) in materialsystem.dll
		- HOLY SHIT THE RAYCAST VEHICLE IS BACKWARDS!
- TODO
	- Support concave meshes (see: trash dumpster)
	- Vehicles: bullet's vehicle wheels aren't physical, but IVP's wheels were. We need to sync the CPhysicsObject wheels with the virtual wheels on the raycast car.
