- Bugs
	- Anything except solid brushes intersecting with an object causes FPS to GRADUALLY decrease. Removing the not solid brush from the object will make FPS GRADUALLY increase (in gm_construct).
	- Bouyancy calculations taking too long(?) Large amounts of lag caused if many objects are intersecting with water at once.
	- Dynamite model acts odd (inconsistency between server and client predictions?) Physical model is detached from graphical model.
	- IsAsleep() returning true causes lag freeze (Only when object asleep on displacements?)
	- Mystical magnetic properities depending on if using singlethreaded or multithreaded.
		- Singlethreaded: attractive (literally, use your physgun)
		- Multithreaded: repulsive (object will bounce if on top of another)
	- Immense lag when an object is welded to world and crash when removing that weld in materialsystem
	- VEHICLES:
		- One of the wheels fly off in vehicle creation. (front left)
		- Vehicles cause a crash when removed. The wheels are already removed before being deleted from the queued object list.
		- HOLY SHIT THE RAYCAST VEHICLE IS BACKWARDS!
	- Parallel Constraint Solver crash: Manifold has a body that isn't in the bodies array!
- TODO
	- Support concave meshes (see: trash dumpster)
	- In the future, expose unexposed functions to the lua states under table physenv (or get garry to support them). Expose features such as:
		- Soft bodies
		- Scaling of models
